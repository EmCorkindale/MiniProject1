    review:
      '"Michelle was fantastic to work with and would 100% use her again. Really knew the market and who we were targeting. Communication was excellent and she answered all of our questions quickly and honestly. She had great ideas for staging too. Michelle was totally invested in selling our property and always gave her all at the open homes and catch up meetings. She really wanted to make this an easy process and get us the best possible price we could. Totally seamless and stress free experience!"',

Michelle was very down to earth and happy to explain the whole auction process to us when we had no idea what we were doing!

    title:"Excellent sales experience",
    review:
      '"Michelle and Simon worked very hard to market a property which was always going to present challenges. She displayed commitment to delivering a campaign which had enough punch to attract what looked like a number of serious prospects.On the day of the auction, Michelle went all out to get the best result in a flat market.we as owners could easily have walked away with no sale but the Harcourts team I thought did a great job of keeping the sale alive. There is no comparison basis between Michelleâ€™s team and a local Akaroa competitor who came up with no result in almost a year. There was honesty attached to the sales process which I thought was commendable and at no time did I feel left out of the communication loop. In all, well done, great effort and although sale price was well below our expectations, we have a result which allows us to move on! Thankyou."',

    title:"Most trusted agent ever!",
    review:
      '"We engaged with Michelle due to the reputation she has within a competitive market. Michelle listened to us, engaged us with the information we needed to make decisions that suited our budget, but more importantly, gave us the greatest chance of getting the price we wanted. Given the current economic climate, we were more than impressed with the end result. At no point did we feel disconnected, even though we reside in Australia. The reports we received each week reassured us that we were on target. Simon and Michelle would provide updates via email, text or phone calls.The advice we received was spot on. Their true authentic personalities was perfect for us as Michelle and Simon appreciate that selling and buying a house is stressful. They engaged a wonderful business to put furniture in our house that highlighted the features of it. Without a doubt, the team of Michelle and Simon by your side is one you will not be disappointed with!"',

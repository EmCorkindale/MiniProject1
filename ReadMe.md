What was your requirements gathering and design process? Was it useful/successful?
I spoke with the client and discussed the requirements for the project. We drafted up a list of must have items, and items he would like to be added in the future.
I drew out some lo-fi sketches of the site, and the client was happy to proceed to the Hi-fi designs.
I gathered some inspiration from different sources for layout and design. My client wanted the website to be simple with clean lines, and because we are working within branding 
guidlines, we had to limit the colour pallete. 
I mocked up the Hi-fi designs, and once the client was happy with these I began the process of building the site. 

Give a high level overview of your application and its features
My application is a landing page for Corkindale and Co, a real estate company.
It opens on the home page, featuring a navigation bar with drop down menus. The background for the home page is a video of one of the current lisitings.
At the bottom of the home page, the latest client reviews are displayed and rotate every 30 sec.
The previous listing page has cards that display the previous lisitings, and the current listings page does this as well.

Where does its data come from (external/internal APIs)?
The data comes from json files which are displayed on the bootstrap cards, as well as a json array displaying the latest reviews.

How is this data processed and displayed?
The data was sourced using a fetch. Some of the data is displayed using a SetInterval function, some through Bootstrap Cards, and some through charts.

How can the user interact with your application?
The user can fill out a contact form to submit their information for an appraisal. They can also navigate through the page using the nav bar and drop down menu.

What JS techniques have you used (eg. objects, arrays, DOM functions, loops, functions)?
I have used json objects, arrays, DOM functions (have had to use css in different ways because of the DOM), functions, fetch, setInterval 

What external tools/libraries have you used (eg. bootstrap/axios/charts)? How? Why?
I have used Bootstrap for my navbar, contact form modal, and listing cards. I found it easier to do this to set the website up for responsiveness, however found editing the css far more difficult this way and had some issues with the contact form modal. I used Iconify in my listing cards.
I have also used charts to display auction sales.

What kinds of HTML elements have you used (eg. tables, forms, divs, lists, headings, menus, videos, images)?
I have used a lot of divs to set up elements of my pages, as well as videos, headings, images, lists, and forms.

What kinds of CSS features have you used (eg. animations, backgrounds, fonts, colours, flexbox, grid)?
I have used animations, backgrounds, fonts, colours, flexbox, fonts.

How might you extend the features of your application in future?
I would like to have more pages that match the drop down menus. My client would also like a blog in future, and would like a section for user's to see what properties in their area have sold for.
